            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Chicken Katsu
            <ul>
                <li>5 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
                <li>salt and black ground pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 large beaten egg</li>
                <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup high temperature frying oil</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul> 
    <p> Recipe Steps: </p>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong> Step 1 </strong> </li>
            <p>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add onions to the hot oil and fry until soft and starting to caramelize, about 8 minutes.</p>
            <p>Add carrots. Pour in water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until carrots are soft, about 30 minutes.</p>
        <li> <strong> Step 2 </strong> </li>
            <p>Remove from the heat and add curry sauce mix; stir well until all pieces are dissolved. </p>
            <p>If you'd like to add other seasonings, do so now. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or longer if you'd like it thicker.</p>
        <li> <strong> Step 3 </strong> </li>
            <p> While the curry is infusing, flatten the chicken breasts with a kitchen mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</p>
            <p> Season with salt and pepper. Drench in flour, then egg, and then coat generously with panko bread crumbs. </p>
        <li> <strong> Step 4 </strong> </li>
            <p>Heat oil in a separate saucepan to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). </p>
            <p> Carefully lower breaded cutlets into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. </p>
        <li> <strong> Step 5 </strong> </li>
            <p> After the chicken has cooked, slice them into strips and plate your curry and rice. You're done! </p>
    </ol>
