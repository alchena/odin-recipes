    <p class="para-header"><strong>Recipe Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Step 1</strong> </li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Season short ribs with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. 
        <p>Working in 2 batches, brown short ribs on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch.</p>
        <p>Transfer short ribs to a plate. Pour off all but 3 Tbsp. drippings from pot.</p>
        <li> <strong>Step 2</strong> </li>    
        <p>Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are browned, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>Add flour and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until well combined and deep red, 2-3 minutes.</p>
        <P>Stir in wine, then add short ribs with any accumulated juices.</p>
        <p>Bring to a boil; lower heat to medium and simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 25 minutes.</p>
        <p>Add all herbs to pot along with garlic. Stir in stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to oven.</p>
        <li> <strong>Step 3</strong> </li>    
        <p>Cook until short ribs are tender, 2-2.5 hours. Transfer short ribs to a platter.</p>
        <p>Strain sauce from pot into a measuring cup.</p>
        <p>Spoon fat from surface of sauce and discard; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>Serve in shallow bowls over mashed potatoes with sauce spooned over.</p>
